# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

For my first milestone, I created a circuit and worked on building the main coding of the knocks. The circuit is fairly simple with the board reading in a sensor and then triggering an LED to light up. Originally, I had used a button which used a digital pin, but I also switched it to the piezo sensor which detects vibrations and was analog. My first revision of code was to light up the LED when a button was pressed around 1 second after each other. It would read the number of milliseconds that passed since the program started and found the difference between the two presses. Then it would compare the difference with 1 second allowing a small margin of error. One problem I faced was getting the code to not read in all the values if a button is accidently held down, but I was able to fix this with a simple Boolean for changing states. After that; I wrote code that allowed the user to input the time by pressing the correct sequence in the beginning of the program.
